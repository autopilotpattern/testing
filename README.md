# Testing the Autopilot Pattern

*Tooling for testing applications built using the Autopilot Pattern.*

This repo contains a Python module `testcases` which provides a Python `unittest.TestCase` subclass which can be used to create integration tests of applications by driving Docker Compose.

See the [API documentation](https://github.com/autopilotpattern/testing/blob/master/API.md) for details on the methods made available on the `AutopilotPatternTest` class.
